# Intransparent: Independent Validation of Social Media Transparency Data

This repository curates transparency data published by social media firms, with
a focus on child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and the code to analyze that same
data, with a focus on assessing its quality. The focus on CSAM is not arbitrary:
As "electronic communication service providers," all US-based social media firms
are [legally required](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258A) to
report such material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
(NCMEC). The Center receives reports through its CyberTipline, triages them, and
then routes them to appropriate national and international law enforcement
agencies. Similar to social media companies, NCMEC started making transparency
disclosures has startThat raises
the possibility of validating social media firms' transparency disclosures by
comparing them to those made by NCMEC.


## The Data

While a few CSV files contain [tidy
data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf), others are decidedly untidy
with, for example, individual columns combining two variables. That typically
reflects the organization of the original disclosure and helps ensure
correctness of data transcription. This repository's Python code illustrates how
to tidy up such data.


### Dataset 1: CSAM Reports per Year (1998 onward)

The [CSAM reports per year](data/csam-reports-per-year.csv) dataset captures the
number of reports NCMEC received on its CyberTipline since inception in March
1998, as disclosed in Appendix A of its [CY 2022 Report to the Committees on
Appropriations](https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/OJJDP-NCMEC-Transparency_2022-Calendar-Year.pdf).


### Dataset 2: CSAM Report Contents (2020 onward)

The [CSAM report contents](data/csam-report-contents.csv) dataset breaks down
the reports NCMEC received by:

  * the category of sexual exploitation, e.g., whether a report concerns child
    pornography, misleading words/images, online enticement, child sex
    trafficking, obscene material sent to a child, misleading domain names,
    child sexual molestation, or child sex tourism;
  * the kind of attachments, e.g., photos, videos, or other;
  * the uniqueness of attachments as determined by a precise hash (MD5) and a
    perceptual hash (PhotoDNA, Videntifier).

Labels for the latter classification use "unique" for precisely hashed
attachments and "similar" for perceptually hashed ones. The dataset combines
several tables from NCMEC's [CY 2022 Report to the Committees on
Appropriations](https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/OJJDP-NCMEC-Transparency_2022-Calendar-Year.pdf).


### Dataset 3: CSAM Reports per Platform (2019 onward)

The [CSAM reports per platform](data/csam-reports-per-platform.json) dataset is
the main dataset provided by this repository. It collects:

  * the CSAM disclosures by major non-Chinese social networks;
  * corresponding disclosures about platforms' reporting by NCMEC.

The above linked JSON format is [automatically
generated](intransparent/platform/export.py) from a [Python
module](intransparent/platform/data.py). Both formats have the same structure
and contain the same information.

The dataset incorporates information about these platforms:

  * Facebook
  * Instagram
  * LinkedIn
  * Pinterest
  * Quora
  * Reddit
  * Snap
  * Telegram
  * TikTok
  * Tumblr
  * Twitter
  * WhatsApp
  * Wordpress
  * YouTube

It also incorporates information about the following companies operating one or
more of the above platforms:

  * Automattic (Tumblr and Wordpress)
  * Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
  * Google (YouTube)

A separate [codebook](codebook.md) documents the JSON and Python formats.
Basically, they consist of a top-level object that maps organization names to an
object with the data about that organization. Since platforms vary widely in
what metrics they disclose, the format necessarily is rather generic and
collects all of a platform's quantitative disclosures within one table:

  * Since platforms make transparency disclosures for quarter, half, and full
    years, each table also organizes metrics into time periods with the same
    granularity.
  * To faithfully capture disclosures, time periods may vary within a table.
    They may also overlap, both to capture several partial disclosures and to
    capture several redundant disclosures. A flag clearly marks the latter
    entries.
  * Where possible, the table uses standard labels for equivalent metrics:

      * _reports_ tallies CSAM reports to NCMEC;
      * _pieces_ tallies instances of CSAM such as pictures and videos;
      * _accounts_ tallies user registrations implicated *and* terminated
        for CSAM;

    Instead of "account termination," many platforms use a euphemism such as
    "permanent suspension." User registrations thusly impacted *are* included
    under *accounts*. However, temporarily impacted registrations are not.


### Dataset 4: CSAM Reports per Country (2019 onward)

[CSAM reports per country](data/csam-reports-per-country.csv) collects NCMEC's
per-country breakdown of CSAM reports for
[2019](https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/2019-cybertipline-reports-by-country.pdf),
[2020](https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/2020-reports-by-country.pdf),
[2021](https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/2021-reports-by-country.pdf),
and
[2022](https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/2022-reports-by-country.pdf)
in machine-readable form. The CSV table is mostly straightforward: Its first two
columns comprise the country name and ISO three-letter code, followed by a
column per year from 2019 through 2022.

To preserve all information from NCMEC's disclosures, the table includes rows
for the Netherlands Antilles (ANT), "Europe" (EEE), Bouvet Island (BVT), and "No
Country Listed" (*no code*). NCMEC does not explain its inclusion of Europe in
addition to individual European countries nor the Netherlands Antilles in
addition to its 2010 successors Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba (BES), Cura√ßao
(CUW), and Sint Maarten (SXM). Neither do they explain the inclusion of Bouvet
Island; the subantarctic dependency of Norway is an uninhabited nature reserve
and hence rather unlikely to serve as actual location of internet users.

This repository's Python package includes [code that
enriches](intransparent/country.py) this dataset with population counts,
geometries, and region/continent information. It leverages the following data:

  * Per-country population counts by the [United Nations Population
    Division](https://population.un.org/dataportal/data/indicators/49/locations/4,8,12,16,20,24,660,28,32,51,533,36,40,31,44,48,50,52,112,56,84,204,60,64,68,535,70,72,76,92,96,100,854,108,132,116,120,124,136,140,148,152,156,344,446,158,170,174,178,184,188,384,191,192,531,196,203,408,180,208,262,212,214,218,818,222,226,232,233,748,231,238,234,242,246,250,254,258,266,270,268,276,288,292,300,304,308,312,316,320,831,324,624,328,332,336,340,348,352,356,360,364,368,372,833,376,380,388,392,832,400,398,404,296,412,414,417,418,428,422,426,430,434,438,440,442,450,454,458,462,466,470,584,474,478,480,175,484,583,492,496,499,500,504,508,104,516,520,524,528,540,554,558,562,566,570,807,580,578,512,586,585,591,598,600,604,608,616,620,630,634,410,498,638,642,643,646,652,654,659,662,663,666,670,882,674,678,682,686,688,690,694,702,534,703,705,90,706,710,728,724,144,275,729,740,752,756,760,762,764,626,768,772,776,780,788,792,795,796,798,800,804,784,826,834,840,850,858,860,548,862,704,876,732,887,894,716/start/2019/end/2022/table/pivotbylocation);
  * Per-country internet user counts prepared by [Our World in
    Data](https://ourworldindata.org/internet) from statistics released by the
    International Telecommunication Union via WorldBank as well as the United
    Nations;
  * Administrative boundaries for countries by [Natural Earth, version
    5.1.1](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/);
  * Per-country ISO 3166 Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 codes scraped from [ISO's
    website](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) and corresponding region
    names based on [Luke Duncalfe's ISO-3166
    dataset](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes).

per country CSAM reports:

### Dataset 5: Meta's Quarterly Transparency Data (Q1 2021 onward)

Meta's quarterly transparency disclosures include a CSV file with data for the
current and all previous quarters in machine-readable form. Presumably, for just
reason Meta does not maintain an externally accessible archive of previously
released CSV files. This dataset collects the quarterly CSV files from Q2 2021
onward. Files prior to Q2 2022 were retrieved from archive.org's snapshots for
the [unchanging URL](https://transparency.fb.com/sr/community-standards/) for
the data and files for that and later quarters were manually downloaded from the
URL. The files are included because a small but significant number of historical
quantities changed every quarter until 2023.


### Dataset 6: Relationship between Offender and Victim

The [CSAM pieces by relationship to
victim](data/csam-pieces-by-relationship-to-victim.csv) dataset captures the
relationship between suspected offenders and victims as determined by law
enforcement agencies and tabulated by NCMEC. It is included in NCMEC's [CY 2022
Report to the Committees on
Appropriations](https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/OJJDP-NCMEC-Transparency_2022-Calendar-Year.pdf)
as part of a grant by the Office for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention (OJJDP).

Since the number of victims in NCMEC's database seems to be very small, I pulled
in two more datasets characterizing relationships as well. [The
first](data/ojjdp-qa02403-2019.csv) stems from [OJJDP's Statistical Briefing
Book](https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/victims/qa02403.asp?qaDate=2019) and covers
years 2018 and 2019. The data was originally extracted from the FBI's National
Incident-Based Reporting System Master Files. Note that all counts are relative
to "typical 1,000 sexual assaults." [The
second](data/learcat-relationship-2016.csv) stems from
[LEARCAT](https://learcat.bjs.ojp.gov) and covers the year 2016. It also draws
on the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System. While the Briefing Book
data is helpful indeed, the choice of relationship bins for the LEARCAT data
renders it close to useless in this context.


## Repository Layout

In addition to the data, this repository also contains the Python code for
analyzing it as well as resulting figures. In particular:

  - The `analysis` directory contains notebooks with the high-level analysis
    code. The `index.ipynb` notebook includes almost all other notebooks.
  - The `intransparent` directory contains the Python library code used by the
    notebooks.
      - The remaining code in `intransparent.main` should be refactored into
        notebooks.
      - The `show()` function in `intransparent.show` is more generally useful.
        Most of this functionality should be up-streamed to Pandas because it
        significantly improves on the default table format.
  - The `figure` directory contains SVG figures.
  - The `stubs` directory contains typing stubs.
  - The `report` directory contains the LaTeX sources for the article discussing
    the work.
